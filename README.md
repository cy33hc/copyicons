# copyicons

This application is used for bulk copying of icon0.png/pic0.png from the ux0:app/<GAME>/sce_sys for to the ur0:appmeta/<GAME> folder

The psvita can only load 500 bubbles. If you have more then 500 apps/games install. The vita will not create the icon0.png and pic0.png files in the ur0:appmeta folder.

## Features

1. Decrypt the icon0.png/pic0.png and copy to ur0:appmeta.
2. Like mentioned this app scans every game in the ux0:app folder and copies the icon0.png/pic0.png if it's not found in ur0:appmeta

## Controls
There are no controls. Just run the app and wait for it to complete. Progress is shown on the screen.

## Credits
Thx to theFlow for Vitashell. I had copied the modules from Vitashell needed to pfs mount the game to decypt the content.
